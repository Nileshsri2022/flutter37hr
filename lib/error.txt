it is giving null in main.dart beacause you have switch between LoginView() and HomePage() which logout user so it is giving null solved by using hot reload function of flutter extension
print(FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser?.email);
Ticker error which is solved by flutter upgrade it takes time
Dont stop any process and do proper shutdown

The only alternative to a git pull would be a git push --force and delete .git folder if you want to push to main -> main 
git tag "step-1"
git push --tags
